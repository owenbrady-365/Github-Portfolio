 <!-- Things to Add:
        -complex conainer shape for OW-ENgineering logo home button
        -button highlight when hovering over each one
        -button / text shadows
        -transparent portrait with name / gender / pronoun title card
        -fix home button location in each page
        -actually design tile-able background for whole website > design for smaller screens, scale up for monitors
        -Use accent colors somehow, perhaps in the headers, on hover of each page button, randomly for each <div> tile?

                   Welcome! I'm Owen Brady, a 26 year old aspiring mechanical / aerospace engineer. In my lifetime, I would like to help research and 
                        develop novel electric aircraft. 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        I am currently enrolled as a full-time Mechanical Engnineering student at 
                        <a href="https://camosun.ca/programs-courses/find-program/mechanical-engineering-technology-diploma">Camosun College.</a> My Goals
                        for my education are to graduate the diploma program with an A average, complete the UVIC bridge program, and then graduate from UVIC with a Bachelors degree in Aerospace Engineering. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    This website is designed to showcase my skills, experiences, and accomplishments in the field of engineering.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My goal is to provide a comprehensive overview of my journey as an engineer, and to demonstrate my passion for innovation and problem-solving. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Thank you for visiting, and I hope you find the information here informative and engaging.</p>

                        In my personal life, I like to work on my body and mind. That's why you'll often find me out cycling on the streets, working out 
                        in my home-gym, making a balanced and healthy meal, or working on one of my several hobbies. My hobbies all mostly revolve around 
                        becoming the best engineer I can be, that's why they include the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Practicing Academics [Calculus, Statics, Fluid Mechanics, English Grammar]</li>
                                <li>Designing Minor and Major Projects [SOLIDWORKS, 3D Printing, Programming, Sewing]</li>
                                <li>Managing finances / reducing costs</li>
                                <li>Sketching / Illustrating </li>
                                <li>Reading [Scientific Literature, Genre Aesthetics, and Self-Improvement</li>
                            </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the about me section, I plan on adding a "Core Directives" section. This seciton basically describes some personal quotes and 
                        found quotes that I like to keep in mind. They should reflect who I am, and not be super cringy or philisophical. I want the reader to 
                        agree with the quotes, denoting they aren't bad to follow, while also convincing them I am a trustyworthy and hard working individual.
                        I could also see adding a general timeline of my education and awards, basic work history, along with smaller notations for any
                        projects I want to denote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also like to include links to my social media's [linkedin, instagram, facebook?], and add some specifically chosen pictures to 
                        be on the front page. I would like them to be positioned so they are not in the way and look clean.
