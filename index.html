 <!-- Things to Add:
        -complex conainer shape for OW-ENgineering logo home button
        -button highlight when hovering over each one
        -button / text shadows
        -transparent portrait with name / gender / pronoun title card
        -fix home button location in each page
        -actually design tile-able background for whole website > design for smaller screens, scale up for monitors
        -Use accent colors somehow, perhaps in the headers, on hover of each page button, randomly for each <div> tile?

                        These people could include potential employers, coworkers, family, friends, or random people who have heard my name before. I want
                        to make a good first impression, so this page should be designed to show my personal style, be proffesional and clean, be easy to 
                        navigate, and should not leave the viewer confused as to what to do
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I want the first thing they see is a candid portrait of myself and a section that briefly summarizes who I am, what I do, and where
                        I want to go in life. An example of this could look like the f5ollowing:

                        Hello, I'm Owen Brady, a 26 year old aspiring mechanical / aerospace engineer. In my lifetime, I would like to help research and 
                        develop novel electric aircraft. I am currently enrolled as a full-time Mechanical Engnineering student at 
                        <a href="https://camosun.ca/programs-courses/find-program/mechanical-engineering-technology-diploma">Camosun College.</a> My Goals
                        for my education are to graduate the diploma program, bridge to UVIC, and spend more time learning there.  
                    </p>
                    <p class="shifted">
                        In my personal life, I like to train my body and my mind. That's why you'll often find me out cycling on the streets, working out 
                        in my home-gym, making balanced and healthy meal, or working on one of my several hobbies. My hobbies all mostly revolve around 
                        becoming the best engineer I can be, that's why they include the following:
                            <ul>
                                <li>Practicing Academics [Math & Physics]</li>
                                <li>Desiging Novel Model Aircraft [small gliders & powered rc crafts]</li>
                                <li>Managing finances / reducing costs</li>
                                <li>Drawing technical images of concept aircraft</li>
                                <li>Reading [Scientific Literature,Philosophy, and Self-Improvement</li>
                            </ul>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the about me section, I plan on adding a "Core Directives" section. This seciton basically describes some personal quotes and 
                        found quotes that I like to keep in mind. They should reflect who I am, and not be super cringy or philisophical. I want the reader to 
                        agree with the quotes, denoting they aren't bad to follow, while also convincing them I am a trustyworthy and hard working individual.
                        I could also see adding a general timeline of my education and awards, basic work history, along with smaller notations for any
                        projects I want to denote.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I would also like to include links to my social media's [linkedin, instagram, facebook?], and add some specifically chosen pictures to 
                        be on the front page. I would like them to be positioned so they are not in the way and look clean. The home button should go on the 
                        left of the navigation bar, and I would like it to be the OW-ENgineering Ltd. logo I designed. Alternatively, I was thinking about 
                        locating the logo on the right side of the navigation bar so the whole page looked cleaner, but I'm still undecided about that one.
