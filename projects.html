    <h1>This will be where all of my projects are added.</h1>
    <p>
        This page is going to be dedicated to all of the projects I have worked on throughout my life, both major and minor. The goal of this page
        is to showcase my skills as a designer and engineer, as well as to provide potential employers with a portfolio of my work. Another goal of  
        this page is to allow for easy tracking of all my completed projects as I complete them in the future.
    </p>    
    
    <p>
            The idea with this page is I will make a tiled gallery sorta, where each tile consists of a 
            general picture, title, and quick description of the project goals. There will be filters 
            to sort the list by [complexity /10, date, categories like aircraft, housecraft, major / minor projects, etc].
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Another option for this page is to split it into separate pages for major projects, where I give a detailed description of my goals,
            deisgn process, and any other relevant pictures / data to complelety show my off my projects. Long-term results can also be included here. 
            For minor pages, I could still use the gallery feature as described above, but include little pop-ups that give a little more detail about
            each one. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>There are lots of ways to organize this page, but the overall goal is to keep it clean, easy to navigate, and easy to add to.</p>
        <br>
        <p> A quick list of the major / minor projects I should include:</p>
